# ImagePacker

A command line tool to pack a set of images into a single, larger image

Copyright (c) 2013, Javier Arevalo. Licensed under the MIT license.

Uses Sean Barret's image libraries from [http://nothings.org/](http://nothings.org/) 

Uses a modified version of the Guillotine bin packing algorithm by Jukka Jyl√§nki from [https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack](https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack).

## Usage

    Usage: imgp in_files [-options]
      Options:
        -o, --output-filename filename    Output filename (mandatory)
        -minw, --min-width    number      Minimum output width [64]
        -maxw, --max-width    number      Maximum output width [4096]
        -minh, --min-height   number      Minimum output height [64]
        -maxh, --max-height   number      Maximum output height [4096]
        -padx, --padding-x    number      Horizontal space between images [1]
        -pady, --padding-y    number      Vertical space between images [1]
        -fmt, --map-format    format      Format of the map file [plist]
        -rot, --allow-rotate              Images can be rotated 90 deg
        -sq, --force-square               Output must be square
      Valid formats: plist, json-array, json-hash, txt

The output filename determines where the resulting image (always .png) and map file will be saved.

Examples:

    imgp Bitmaps/* -o Atlas/atlas.png -fmt json -flip
    imgp Bitmaps/* -o=Atlas/atlas -fmt=txt -sq -flip -minw=256 -minh=256

Resulting PNG files are not optimally compressed. I recommend using something like
[optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) or [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/)

Note: Not heavily tested yet, output formats may be still bogus.

## Building

Get the latest source code from [https://github.com/TheJare/imgp.git](https://github.com/TheJare/imgp.git)

On Windows, you can use the provided VS2012 project & solution, or run `mkvc.bat` on the command-line. For OSX and Linux you can run `./mkclang` or `./mkgcc` depending on your compiler.

The source code uses C++11 features and therefore requires a recent compiler. Tested with Visual Studio 2012 & 2013, clang 3.3/OSX and gcc 4.7/Ubuntu.
