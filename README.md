A command line tool to pack a set of images into a single, larger image

Copyright (c) 2013, Javier Arevalo. Licensed under the MIT license.

Uses Sean Barret's image libraries from [http://nothings.org/](http://nothings.org/) 

Uses a modified version of the Guillotine bin packing algorithm by Jukka Jyl√§nki from [https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack](https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack).

## Usage

    Usage: ImagePacker in_files [-options]
      Options:
        -o, --output-filename filename    Output filename (mandatory)
        -minw, --min-width    number      Minimum output width [64]
        -maxw, --max-width    number      Maximum output width [4096]
        -minh, --min-height   number      Minimum output height [64]
        -maxh, --max-height   number      Maximum output height [4096]
        -padx, --padding-x    number      Horizontal space between images [1]
        -pady, --padding-y    number      Vertical space between images [1]
        -fmt, --map-format    [json,plist,txt] Format of the map file [plist]
        -flip, --allow-flip               Images can be flipped
        -sq, --force-square               Output must be square

The output filename determines where the resulting image (always .png) and map file will be saved.

Examples:

    imgp Bitmaps/* -o Atlas/atlas.png -fmt json -flip
    imgp Bitmaps/* -o=Atlas/atlas -fmt=txt -sq -flip -minw=256 -minh=256

Note: Not heavily tested yet!

## Building

Get the latest source code from []()

Windows:

    vc.bat

OSX / Linux (using clang):

    ./mkclang

Note: the source code uses C++11 features and therefore requires a recent Visual Studio (2012+) or clang (3.0+)
